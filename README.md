MyFirstEverProgram
==================

Im so chuffed to have found this and resuce it off a floppy disk.  This is the first ever program that I wrote, which started my intrest in programing way back in 2002 when floppy disk's ruled the world.  It's a who wants to be a millionare game for a college asingment.  Im putting it up here for historic reasons and to remind myself of how far I have come since then.
